# Heart Disease Classification

This programme builds and trains a machine learning classification model to predict heart failure prevalance based on comorbidities. This includes:
- Code to explore and clean data using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Training and testing a Random Forest Classification machine learning model using Scikit Learn
- Comparison across different models, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression
- Exporting the machine learning model for re-use elsewhere
